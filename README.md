<h1 align="center">Free Spotify</h1>

Free Spotify - Works almost same as spotify at least you can search and listen, has no ads, accounts or anything related to commercial.</h4>

As the metadata to get song links, images, length and etc. I used [Spotify Explode](https://github.com/jerry08/SpotifyExplode) (thank you Jerry so much for wonderful API!)

As the audio player to play sounds I used [YouTube Explode](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode) to retrive stream of audio.

As the Discord Status I used [Spotify Explode](https://github.com/jerry08/SpotifyExplode) + [Discord RPC](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp) made by Lachee

This project was being made just for fun, and I'm really proud of it.

Feel free to copy and update this app, do not use for commercial use!
